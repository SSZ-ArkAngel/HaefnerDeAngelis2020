Project: Motion processing

Project: Understanding how motion perception depends on one’s own motion in the world

Background: Humans (and animals) constantly have to make infer the motion of objects in the world. Since the motion on the retina is a combination of both self-motion and the actual object motion they’ll need to account for the former to correctly estimate the latter. This process leads to “biases” in how we perceive moving objects on a screen – depending on the motion of other objects on the screen, e.g. optic flow indicating self-motion. How to best model this process, and how this process is implemented by neural circuits is the topic of ongoing research in many labs, including those of Greg DeAngelis and Ralf Haefner.

Paper:  Warren, P. A., & Rushton, S. K. (2009). Optic Flow Processing for the Assessment of Object Movement during Ego Movement. Current Biology, 19(18), 1555–1560. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.07.057

Summary: Subjects report the perceived direction of motion of an object on the screen in the presence of moving dots simulating the optic flow caused by self-motion. This study investigates how those reports are biased by the optic flow, and how this bias depends on the details of the optic flow (e.g. how realistic and compelling it is at inducing a sense of self-motion).

Impact: This is a classic (2009) study that has already been replicated in various forms. However, it raises a number of interesting questions about the implications of those biases for models of motion perception – not just in the presence of self-motion but also in the presence of hierarchical object motion (e.g. the perceived motion of a person walking on a moving train: also see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F5ICP9SYLU from 1:23min). Studying related biases/illusions could be the topic of follow-up experiments in the second semester.

Skills required: Stimulus/response programming in Matlab.
